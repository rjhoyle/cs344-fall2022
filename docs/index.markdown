## Discussions
Discussions will be held using Piazza.  The enrollment link is on Blackboard.  

## Textbooks
No textbooks are required.  All readings are free for download through the Oberlin College network or available on Blackboard.  Please do not purchase any papers for reading, as you will not need to.

## Mask Policy
The Oberlin Computer Science Department is dedicated to making Computer Science accessible to all students.  Because of this, we will be requiring that all students wear masks in our classrooms and lab spaces this semester.  By masking, you are not only demonstrating respect and kindness for your classmates, but also making sure that medically at-risk students have a learning experience where they can feel comfortable and safe.  Masking will be required for classes, lab periods, drop-in lab helping, and anytime you are using the CS labs or offices.  If you have forgotten to bring a mask with you, an instructor can provide you with one.  

## Course Description

From the [Oberlin catalog course description](http://www.oberlin.edu/catalog/college/compsci.html):

In today’s networked and electronic society, personal information and social habits are increasingly available to potentially unauthorized parties. The protection of this information requires balancing social, legal, and economic pressures. This course will introduce students to current research that tackles such privacy challenges in an interdisciplinary approach. We will cover topics such as anonymizing networks, censorship-resistant publishing, location privacy, information sharing in mobile and social networks, electronic voting, and wearable computing. This seminar will be driven by student presentations of papers accompanied by in-depth interactive discussions of the material. Building on knowledge gained in class, students will work on research projects in groups and present their findings at the end of the semester.

## Course Goals

My goals and objectives for students taking this course are as follows:

1. Be comfortable reading primary literature in computer science
1. Develop expertise in a research project
1. Develop technical writing skills in the sciences
1. Understand issues surrounding privacy and security as they apply to social networks and society at large
1. Make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on the quantitative and/or formal analysis of data
1. Identify the assumptions within formal reasoning / mathematical methods; assess the reliability, generalizability, and uncertainty of conclusions; recognize the risks of using methods improperly
1. Relay results in a manner appropriate to the audience using suitable terminology, symbols, and conventions
